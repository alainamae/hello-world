# hello-world
Welcome to my GitHub repository!
Hello there! My name is Alaina and I can say that I'm a complete K-Drama fan who can't resist a satisfying love story or a surprising plot turn. I place a high value on friendship and fostering positive energy. I'm an approachable person. It's my passion to learn new things, and I'm always up for an adventure or a deep dive into something new.
